## Chapter 1: Approaching Forecasting (Page 23) #1-5

Impact of September 11 on Air Travel in the United States: The Research
and Innovative Technology Administration’s Bureau of
Transportation Statistics (BTS) conducted a study to evaluate
the impact of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on U.S.
transportation. The study report and the data can be found at
www.bts.gov/publications/estimated_impacts_of_9_11_on_us_
travel. The goal of the study was stated as follows:

The purpose of this study is to provide a greater understanding
of the passenger travel behavior patterns of persons making long
distance trips before and after September 11.

The report analyzes monthly passenger movement data between
January 1990 and April 2004. Data on three monthly time series
are given in the file Sept11Travel.xls for this period: 

(1) actual airline revenue passenger miles (Air), 
(2) rail passenger miles (Rail), and 
(3) vehicle miles traveled (Auto).

In order to assess the impact of September 11, BTS took the
following approach: Using data before September 11, it forecasted
future data (under the assumption of no terrorist attack).
Then, BTS compared the forecasted series with the actual data to
assess the impact of the event.


#1 Is the goal of this study descriptive or predictive?

The goal of the study is descriptive to see the impact of Sep 11 terrorist 
attack on passengers long distance travel behavior.

#2 What is the forecast horizon to consider in this task? Are next-month forecasts sufficient?

The forecast horizon is from Sep 2001 to the last record which is Apr 2004. 
But it also possible that only half of the that range of time is sufficient 
to view the effects of the terrorist attack on long distance travel behavior. 
Although, forecasting next-month is too abrupt to see if there is a decreasing 
trend and also a pick up after sometime. 

#3 What level of automation does this forecasting task require? Consider the four questions related to automation.

Automation is not necessary in this case because the forecasting is a 
one time event. Historic data will be used to forecast air RPM, Rail PM, 
and VMT spanning from Sep 2001 to Apr 2004 with the assumption that there 
had been no terrorist attack. The result is said to be compared against the 
actual data from that range of time to assess the effect of the event. This 
hints that the intent of this task is for one time descriptive report.  

#4 What is the meaning of t = 1, 2, 3 in the Air series? Which time period does t = 1 refer to?

t = 1, 2, 3 in the air series denotes to the time period per month. 
So for t = 1, this refers to the airline RPM during entire month of Jan 1990. 

#5. What are the values for y1, y2, and y3 in the Air series?
 
 y1 = 35,153,577 RPM 
 y2 = 454,115,779 PM
 y3 = 163.28 VMT


## Chapter 2: Time Series Data (Page 43) #3

Shipments of Household Appliances: The file ApplianceShipments.xls contains 
the series of quarterly shipments (in millions of USD) of U.S. household 
appliances between 1985-1989.(6)

```{r app I}

#(a) Create a well-formatted time plot of the data.

#Import Dataset:
df <- read_excel('ApplianceShipments.xlsx')
head(df)

#Plot Months
ggplot(df, aes(t, Shipments)) +
  xlab('Quarterly Time Frame from 1985 -1989') + ylab('Shipments') +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks=20) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_classic()

```
#(b) Which of the four components (level, trend, seasonality, noise) seem to be present in this series?

There seems to have an upward trend with a cyclical pattern having curve lines going up and down every full quarter.

Forecasting Shampoo Sales: The file ShampooSales.xls contains
data on the monthly sales of a certain shampoo over a three year
period.

If the goal is forecasting sales in future months, which of the
following steps should be taken? (choose one or more)

• partition the data into training and validation periods
• examine time plots of the series and of model forecasts only
for the training period
• look at MAPE and RMSE values for the training period
• look at MAPE and RMSE values for the validation period
• compute naive forecasts


### The following steps where chosen:

• partition the data into training and validation periods 
- an important preliminary step for forecasting methods. 
Forecast methods can be trained and later on assess for predictive 
performance using the validation results. 

• look at MAPE and RMSE values for the validation period 
- measuring the predictive accuracy of the forecasting model during 
validation is essential to understand how well the performance is. Using 
validation data is preferable because the records are not used to select 
predictors or model parameters.

• compute naive forecasts 
- showing the most recent information is more likely one of the key forecasts 
that can be looked at as the baseline data for comparative assessment. 



## Performance Evaluation (Pages 67-68) #2 and 3

Performance on Training and Validation Data: Two different
models were fit to the same time series. The first 100 time
periods were used for the training period and the last 12
periods were treated as a validation period. Assume that both
models make sense practically and fit the data reasonably
well. Below are the RMSE values for each of the models:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A caption", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("t.png")
```


(a) Which model appears more useful for retrospectively describing the different
components of this time series? Why?

For the training period, it seems that model A is performing better with 
lower values indicating better accuracy. It's the opposite with validation 
period, but the scores are only slightly different from each other with Model B
having relatively better accuracy. But for overall, it might be more useful 
to use Model A with the lowest and presumably better accuracy to describe the 
components of the time series. 


(b) Which model appears to be more useful for forecasting purposes? Why? 

For forecasting, I would look at the validation period instead of the 
training period. Model B with the lowest value and higher accuracy appears 
to be the more useful model for forecasting in this case. Using Model B, the 
reliability of the forecast from comparing the actual against the predictions 
is accurate.
